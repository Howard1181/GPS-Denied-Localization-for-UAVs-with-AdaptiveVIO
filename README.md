# GPS-Denied-Localization-for-UAVs-with-AdaptiveVIO
## Overview
This repository contains a MATLAB simulation for UAV localization in GPS-denied environments.
It integrates EKF-based Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) with KAZE feature matching to estimate the UAV's position using camera and IMU data.

## Preparing the video files
1. Download the necessary video files. link: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FuaIbYU12y2oGX5H3gWTvEByoMPDmIbk?usp=drive_link]
2. Create a folder named `video` at the same level as this repository (i.e., in the same parent directory).
3. Move the downloaded video files into the `video` folder.
